<H1>Fringe Theatre Festival Visitor Schedule Optimiser</H1>

<P>This is a tool to let you select shows and build your own schedule, while
detecting conflicts (including walking times between shows).  It's currently
under construction (alpha version - features still being added), but you're
welcome to give it a try.  I've prefilled the list of events for the Ottawa
Fringe Festival and Animation Festival, though you can do the same by
copying their events-by-date web page and massaging the data enough to paste
into the raw data box.

<P>To use this, first click on the link for a festival, then click the Update
Schedule button to refresh the display, then make your changes.  More
instructions are on later pages.

  <LI><A HREF="http://www.agmsmith.ca/FFVSO/Ottawa2014AnimationFestivalOptimiserStartHere.html">Ottawa International Animation Festival 2014</A>
</UL>

<P>The nifty feature of this web app is that you can paste in the list of
events for any festival into the text box (easiest if you obtain it in
spreadsheet form).  You can even make up your own web pages with pre-filled
event listings (just have the FORM POST redirect to my web server), so that
your friends can edit their own schedules to your festival.  It also uses
old (circa 1997) HTML 3.2 technology, so this should work even without
Javascript.

<P>If you have suggestions on how to improve it, please e-mail me at <A

<P>Current ideas and unimplemented features list:

<UL>
  <LI>Integrate with a mapping service, so it can show you the path to take
    between venues, as well as plotting venue latitude and longitude on a map.

<P>Here's Alex's <A HREF="2014AlexSchedule.html">Personal Schedule</A> for the
2014 Ottawa Fringe Festival, and a <A HREF="2014AlexPrintable.html">printable
version</A>.  I set a new personal high score with 53 shows seen, likely also
the highest attendance in general (at least judging by <A
HREF="https://twitter.com/AGMS00">Tweets</A> from other theatre fanatics).

<P>I've also got an <A HREF="2014AlexOIAF.html">OIAF schedule</A> with a
