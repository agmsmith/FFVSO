<H1>Fringe Theatre Festival Visitor Schedule Optimiser</H1>

<P>This is a tool to let you select shows and build your own schedule, while
detecting conflicts (including walking times between shows).  It's currently
under construction (alpha version - features still being added), but you're
welcome to give it a try.  I've prefilled the list of events for the Ottawa
Fringe Festival and Animation Festival, though you can do the same by copying
their events-by-date web page and massaging the data enough to paste into the
raw data box.

<P>To use this, first click on the link for a festival from the list below,
which will show you the Festival's raw data.  You can ignore the raw data for
now, just click the Update Schedule button to get to the friendlier editing
display with all the checkboxes.  More instructions are on the pages after
that.

  <LI><A HREF="http://www.agmsmith.ca/FFVSO/Ottawa2015FringeFestivalOptimiserStartHere.html">Ottawa Fringe Festival 2015</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.agmsmith.ca/FFVSO/Ottawa2014AnimationFestivalOptimiserStartHere.html">Ottawa International Animation Festival 2014</A>
  <LI><A HREF="http://www.agmsmith.ca/FFVSO/Ottawa2014FringeFestivalOptimiserStartHere.html">Ottawa Fringe Festival 2014</A>
</UL>

<P>Useful features:
<UL>
  <LI>Grays out the unchoosen times for shows you have selected, so you can
    more easily fill time slots with shows you haven't seen.
  <LI>Checks the time between shows to identify conflicts.
  <LI>Factors in the walking time between venues to see if you have enough time
    to get to the next show.  You can specify your walking speed too!
  <LI>Statistics highlight problems with your schedule.  Or let you brag about
    how many shows you've seen or hours you've watched.
  <LI>There's a simple printable listing of your timetable.  Suitable for,
    ummm, printing and taking with you.
  <LI>You can save your choices on your computer for later editing; it's just
    simple text.  Copying the editor web page and e-mailing it to yourself
    often works too.
  <LI>Uses a darker gray (you can change the colours if you wish) for unchoosen
    times where the show is in the future.  This lets you quickly pick an
    earlier time for shows you haven't seen yet; useful when frantically
    adjusting your schedule on the fly to accomodate a show your friends want
    to see.
  <LI>Duplicate shows are shown with a number appended to the show name.
</UL>

<P>The nifty feature of this web app is that you can paste in the list of
events for any festival into the text box (easiest if you obtain it in
spreadsheet form).  You can even make up your own web pages with pre-filled
event listings (just have the FORM POST redirect to my web server), so that
your friends can edit their own schedules to your festival.  It also uses
old (circa 1997) HTML 3.2 technology, so this should work even without
Javascript.

<P>If you have suggestions on how to improve it, please e-mail me at <A
HREF="mailto:?to=%22Alexander G. M. Smith%22 %3Cagmsmith@ncf.ca%3E&amp;subject=Suggestions for Festival Schedule Optimisation">agmsmith@ncf.ca</A>
or use the Twitter hashtag <A
HREF="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23FFVSO">#FFVSO</A> to discuss it.  Note
that the core algorithim is running on my PC (www.agmsmith.ca), so it might be
down once in a while for short periods of time while rebooting.

<P>Current ideas and unimplemented features list:

<UL>
  <LI>Integrate with a mapping service, so it can show you the path to take
    between venues, as well as plotting venue latitude and longitude on a map.
  <LI>Add server-side "include" files for the schedule data.  That would cut
    down on the amount of data transmitted per update (no schedule data in the
    raw data text box) and would make it possible to change the schedule
    without requiring as much user action.
  <LI>Rewrite it as a Java app, or AJAX or Javascript or ... running at the
    client side.  Would give live feedback (totals at the top of the screen
    change immediately when you make a selection).  Useful for automatically
    deselecting a show when you pick it at another time, and so on.
</UL>

<P>Here's my personal <A HREF="2015AlexFringe.html">2015 Ottawa Fringe Festival
Schedule</A>.  Maybe you'll see me at one of the shows!

<P>And some of my other schedules from the past:

  <LI><A HREF="2014AlexSchedule.html">2014 Ottawa Fringe Festival Schedule</A>.
    I set a new personal high score with 53 shows seen, likely also the highest
    attendance in general (at least judging by <A
    HREF="https://twitter.com/AGMS00">Tweets</A> from other theatre fanatics).
</UL>

<P>Source code is available at <A
HREF="http://github.com/agmsmith/FFVSO">http://github.com/agmsmith/FFVSO</A> if
you want to see how it works or just use it on your own web server.  If you want
to, send me an e-mail with your FFVSO web site address and I'll post a list of
installations.
