# Fringe Theatre Festival Visitor Schedule Optimizer

This is a tool to let you select shows and build your own schedule, while detecting conflicts (including walking times between shows).  It's currently under construction (alpha version - features still being added), but you're welcome to give it a [try](http://web.ncf.ca/au829/FFVSO/index.html).

## Useful features:


* Grays out the unchoosen times for shows you have selected, so you can more easily fill time slots with shows you haven't seen.
* Checks the time between shows to identify conflicts.
* Factors in the walking time between venues to see if you have enough time to get to the next show.  You can specify your walking speed too!
* Statistics highlight problems with your schedule.  Or let you brag about how many shows you've seen or hours you've watched.
* There's a simple printable listing of your timetable.  Suitable for, ummm, printing and taking with you.
* You can save your choices on your computer for later editing; it's just simple text.  Copying the editor web page and e-mailing it to yourself often works too.
* Uses a darker gray (you can change the colours if you wish) for unchoosen times where the show is in the future.  This lets you quickly pick an earlier time for shows you haven't seen yet; useful when frantically adjusting your schedule on the fly to accomodate a show your friends want to see.
* Duplicate shows are shown with a number appended to the show name.

The nifty feature of this web app is that you can paste in the list of events for any festival into the text box (easiest if you obtain it in spreadsheet form). You can even make up your own web pages with pre-filled event listings (just have the FORM POST redirect to my web server), so that your friends can edit their own schedules to your festival. It also uses old (circa 1997) HTML 3.2 technology, so this should work even without Javascript.

If you have suggestions on how to improve it, please e-mail me at <agmsmith@ncf.ca> or use the Twitter hashtag [#FFVSO](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23FFVSO) to discuss it.
